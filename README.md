# FP-Space-Odyssey

## Reflection

This first iteration of this project has been both much more time-consuming, and also much smoother to develop. In particular it has become almost second nature to edit my code to comply with the style guide as I write it. This makes things much easier when it comes to final touches and saving time. My major challenge this iteration was solving the issue of having a dynamic game. Creating methods that would allow the game to have semi-random spawning for enemies and attacking delays that made sense and were clean was one that included many versions that I believe now I have figured out.
